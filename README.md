# Syrus-Portfolio


# Purpose
This is my portfolio to showcase my skills as a growing web developer. This portfolio is subject to change over time with the additions of various projects and enhancement to the portfolio site itself.

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

# Project Details
This portfolio currently only contains 1 bootcamp project and the rest of the images under projects are just temporary place holders until more projects have been created.

# Difficulties
I was struggling to create text boxes inside of the place holder projects. I attempted to create title text boxes for all the projects in grandparent/parent/child div's but can't quite figure out how yet. I also attempted to try to seperate my sections even more to make only parent/child levels. This seemed to work at first but I then ran into the problem of trying to figure out how to align all of the seperating sections and divs horizontally. I will have to research more on how to achieve this for future updates.

MediaQeury was a struggle as well. I need to practice and research this more for future updates. I manage to get a lot of the content in my portfolio to scale when screen resolution is changed, but not on a adequate level or a level I am comfortable with.!
